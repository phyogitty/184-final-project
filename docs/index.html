<h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Project Summary</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">Fabric behaves like both a solid and liquid, and simulation of fabric
  involves controlling the interaction between these two types of
  materials. We intend to simulate different fabric models by changing and
  adding parameters to the fabric. Also, we want to investigate the
  interaction of cloth with various materials such as solids, liquids, and
  gases.</p>
  <br>
<h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Problem Description</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">There are many different types of fabrics today.  Some are thin, some are thick. Some of them stretch only in one direction, and some do not have the same weight in all points. Some fabrics do not even smooth out with ironing and are always wrinkled. All of these features are challenging to simulate because they require additional definitions and implementations in the simulation. Also, we tend to simulate fabric interaction with different materials, either physical, such as spheres, and abstract, such as wind. We know the interaction of this type of fabric with other materials is very challenging and thought-provoking. We think that we can simulate clothing by adding different members to the clothing class and implementing some helper functions to change these variables.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="middle"><strong><u>Goals and Deliverables</u></strong></h2>
<p class="text-size">We want to create a more comprehensive class of clothing that can be changed from one type to another by changing its parameters. Changing the characteristics of a garment, in addition to making it look different, makes it interact with other materials and objects differently. We want this simulation to be very real. ​For example, the collision of a sphere with the fabric causes the fabric to stretch. If the fabric is wrinkled, it should return to its original state after it is released. ​In the simulation, the fabric is defined as a simple mesh with different connections. We think working on this simple mesh has a lot of ambition for us. Because of the simplicity of the fabric structure we learned in this class, we have more mastery of change and debugging. ​It is like an empty canvas that we can paint as we wish, and we try and research in some corners and its implementation.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="middle"><u>Planned Demonstration</u></h2>
<p class="text-size">We intend to provide a demo of the effect of collisions between cloth and other objects to show the unique properties of different clothes. With this demo, the effect of the laws of physics on the structure of different fabrics can be seen.<br/><br/>To measure the result of the work, it is necessary to see the details and changes in the fabric in different modes. The more realistic our simulation is, the better the quality of our simulation. So, for the most part, we will be assessing the rendering subjectively.<br/><br/>Can all fabric simulations with mesh and springing simulate different types of cloth or should we change the structure of the cloth class for some fabrics?</p>
